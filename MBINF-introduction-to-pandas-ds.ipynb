    "Pandas is a popular Python library widely used in data science for data manipulation, analysis, and exploration. It provides powerful tools for working with structured data, primarily in the form of two main data structures: Series and DataFrames. In this introduction, I'll focus on DataFrames and their components.\n",

    "A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns that can hold different data types. It is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. DataFrames are incredibly versatile and are used to store, manipulate, and analyze tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components of a DataFrame:**\n",
    "- **Columns:** Columns represent the variables or attributes of the dataset. Each column can hold a specific type of data, such as numbers, strings, or dates.\n",
    "- **Rows (Index):** Rows represent individual observations or records in the dataset. Each row is identified by an index, which can be an integer or a label.\n",
    "- **Index:** The index is a unique identifier for each row in the DataFrame. It helps you access and reference rows using labels or positions.\n",
    "- **Values:** The actual data values are stored in a 2-dimensional array-like structure. Each column contains data of **the same type**.\n",
