### Getting Started

This workshop is designed to be used entirely in a Jupyter Notebook environment. There are instructions below to setup Jupyter notebooks in your local environment. To get started without installing anything locally, please follow the `Google Colab` instructions.

### Google Colab

Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing access free of charge to computing resources including GPUs.

Visit the Google Colab site:
