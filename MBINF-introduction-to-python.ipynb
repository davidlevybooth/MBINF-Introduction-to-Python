    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Python for bioinformatics offers numerous advantages for students in the field. There are many reasons why a bioinformatician would benifit from investing in learning Python:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Versatile Language:** Python is a versatile programming language that is widely used in bioinformatics due to its simplicity and readability. It's an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Most bioinformaticians are introduced to programming through a scripting language like R. While Python can also be used for scripting (ie using Jupyter notebooks), it can also be used in many other use cases such as creating full production applications and APIs.   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rich Libraries and Modules:** Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and modules specifically designed for bioinformatics tasks. These libraries, such as Biopython and scikit-learn, provide pre-built functions and tools for tasks like sequence analysis, data manipulation, and statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Manipulation and Analysis:** Python's data manipulation capabilities make it well-suited for handling large datasets commonly found in bioinformatics. It provides tools for data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis, enabling researchers to draw meaningful insights from biological data. Manipulating data in most commonly used Python tabular data package, Pandas, is significatly faster than using dataframes in R. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sequence Analysis:** Python's string manipulation capabilities are invaluable for sequence analysis tasks, such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequence alignment, motif searching, and mutation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualization:** Python offers a variety of libraries, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn (easy interface for Matplotlib), that allow bioinformaticians to create informative and visually appealing plots and graphs to present their findings effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Machine Learning and AI:** Bioinformatics often involves analyzing complex biological data, and Python's integration with machine learning and artificial intelligence libraries allows students to apply advanced algorithms for tasks like classification, clustering, and prediction. The world of biological data science requires knowledge of ML workflows that are highly developed in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Scripting and Automation:** Python is well-suited for automating repetitive tasks, which is a common need in bioinformatics. Bioinformaticians can create scripts and workflows to process data, perform analyses, and generate reports, saving time and reducing human error. The ability to natively launch cloud-based workflows will take your bioinformatics to the next level. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Job Opportunities:** Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing field, and proficiency in Python is often a prerequisite for job positions in academia, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and healthcare industries. Learning Python can enhance a student's employability and career prospects. There are many flavours of bioinformatics including bioinformatics engineers (akin to a software engineer for biological data), data engineer, and data scientist. For each, industry hiring managers are increasingly looking for solid Python skills. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, learning Python **empowers** bioinformaticians to efficiently analyze biological data, perform complex computations, and develop innovative solutions to challenges in the field. Its user-friendly syntax, extensive libraries, and broad applications make it an essential tool for any aspiring bioinformatician.\n"

In dynamically typed languages, you can change the type of a variable simply by assigning a value of a different type to it, and the language's runtime system handles the necessary type conversions. Other languages like C, Java or TypeScript are  **statically typed**, meaning the type must be declared before using a variable. \n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. Modules allow you to organize your code into separate files, making it easier to manage and reuse. Python comes with a rich standard library that includes many modules for various tasks, such as working with files, handling dates and times, and performing mathematical operations. Additionally, you can install and use third-party modules to extend Python's functionality.\n",

    "**Third-Party Modules:** Third-party modules are not part of the standard library and need to be installed before you can use them. You can use a package manager like `pip` to install third-party modules. For example, to install the requests module, you can run the following command in your terminal:\n",
